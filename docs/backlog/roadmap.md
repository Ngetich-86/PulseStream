## Milestone notes

- **M0.** Rust workspace, API and worker skeletons, health endpoints, env
  config, structured logging, graceful shutdown, local PostgreSQL, CI, ADRs.
- **M1.** `POST /v1/events`, validation, a bounded in-memory queue, bounded
  processing concurrency, `429` on overload, and a bounded shutdown drain.
  Acceptance is **non-durable**
  ([ADR-006](../adr/ADR-006-in-memory-bounded-admission.md)).
- **M2.** Event schema and migrations, the acceptance point, idempotency keys,
  work claiming, crash recovery, and **the delivery semantics document**
  ([ADR-005](../adr/ADR-005-delivery-semantics-deferred.md)).
- **M3.** Retry policy with backoff, dead-letter state, and failure visibility.
- **M4.** Benchmarks and load tests. Evidence-driven tuning, and the broker
  question ([ADR-003](../adr/ADR-003-postgresql-initial-durable-store.md)).
- **M5.** Security review, dependency policy, metrics, and operational runbooks.
- **M6.** Small operations frontend and end-to-end tests.
- **M7.** Release checklist, documentation pass, versioning.
